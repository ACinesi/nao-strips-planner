## About
The aim of this project work on artificial intelligence is to learn how to work with an interactive companion robot and how to deal with the related problems. 

### Objective
 * using the voice recognition
 * analysing the sentence and find out which is the related command
 * creating a sequence of commands (a plan) using strips 
 * accomplishing the plan 
 
The humanoid robot we are taking into account is [NAO H25 IMAGE](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/family/nao_h25/index_h25.html) :
